<h1>The Four Key Variables Used in Code</h1>
  <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>If a set of code is in a loop, then that code will be repeated. How many times the code is repeated can vary. There are infinity loops, which menas that the code will never end. Other loops include those that will repeat until another code of choice kicks in. This is like saying that I will contiue eating until I get full. The point that I am full, I will stop eating. The final type of loop is one that repeats code a specific number of times. An analogy for this is like saying that you are going to feed your pet three times a day.</p>
