<p>Short biography</p>
<h2>Things I Am Obsessed With!</h2>
<p>I LOVE Disney. I literally eat, sleep, and breath Disney! It's my life! Although its legitimately impossible for me to choose a favorite Disney move, one that sticks out has to be Zootopia. I am also in the following fandoms: Warrior Cats, Star Vs. The Forces of Evil (Toffee!!!), and Star Wars Rebels.</p>
<h2>Things That I Am Not Very Obsessed With...(AKA Things I Dislike)</h2>
<p>I am not a fan of scary movies.</p>
